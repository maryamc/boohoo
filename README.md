This is the password generator homework assignment.

In this assignment the password must be between 8-128 characters which encompasses numerical values, special characters, uppercase, and lowercase letters

For the first function "generatePassword();", the user will be prompted a question about how many characters they want their password to contain.
    - The response must be a numerical value between 8-128
    - If the user fails to give a numerical value between 8-128, the user will be alerted that the password is either going to be too short or too long, respectively
    - this also encompasses the different character values that will be asked from the user

I have everything there, however I cant seem to piece it all together. 

All the prompts are working, however my generator keeps coming up as undefined and I honestly do not know how to fix it at this point, so this is my submission for now. Will most definitely be re-doing this assignment.
